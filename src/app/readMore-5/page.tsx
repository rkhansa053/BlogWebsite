      <h2 className="font-bold font-serif">Plot</h2>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      After getting kicked out of the forest for tormenting an influencer camper whom he finds him too annoying until he can learn teamwork,
      Woody decides that he can learn about teamwork in the nearby Camp Woo Hoo, but after arriving, an escaped convict named Buzz Buzzard arrives 
      shortly and then poses as the chef of rival camp Camp Hoo Rah, to rob a hidden treasure.

      After Woody arrives, he befriends Angie the camp director, and her daughter, Maggie, and causes chaos at the camp, but after Buzz's failed attempts to destroy the camp,
      and after Woody gets to know the campers, and helps the campers train for an annual camp game event known as the Wilderness Games, he gets framed for causing chaos again 
      after meeting and fighting Buzz. Inspector Wally Walrus arrives and threatens to shut down the camp. Woody convinces the inspector to give the camp one more chance
      by letting them participate in the Wilderness Games, but Camp Woo Hoo has a history of losing endlessly to Camp Hoo Rah, since they are creative artists and the 
      Hoo Rahs are tough soldiers, thus leaving the campers with low self-esteem. However, after taking a few losses, the Woo Hoos begin to turn their talents into their 
      most effective weapons. As the Games proceed, Buzz observes with dismay and tries to sabotage Woo Hoo's chances of winning, while also communicating on phone calls
      with his accomplice for finding the treasure.

      Before the final challenge, Woody finally discovers Buzz's evil plot to blackmail Zane, the Camp Hoo Rah director and Maggie's uncle, into selling him the two camps,
      and gets locked in the freezer, but later gets inadvertently freed by the mailman, who delivers all of Buzz's arsenal shopping. As Woody is about to leave, 
      Buzz catches sight of Woody, and they start to fight again. The campers of Camp Woo Hoo discover that their fort was destroyed, but despite having no fortifications, 
      Maggie manages to hatch a plan that eliminates almost all of the Hoo Rahs, leaving only one to defend the flag. Woody is overpowered, but manages to fire a flare gun
      and rallies both camps back to the main grounds, where Woody exposes Buzz's illegal arsenal purchasing and plans to steal the treasure. Buzz traps Woody and the campers
      in the kitchen, but they manage to escape. The camps then try to save the chest that Buzz has stolen, but Maggie's belt gets caught and Woody sacrifices his attempt to 
      defeat Buzz and saves Maggie from falling before rendering himself unconscious.

      Afterwards, the camps reconcile when they discover their statue of Obadiah had been the treasure all along, and Woody is filled with emotion when he discovers he has a
      long-forgotten ancestor on the land. The two camps then unite into one camp, with the name Camp Woo Hoo Rah, and even put Woody on their camp flag. Before Woody flies
      back to the forest with his newfound redemption, he hugs Maggie goodbye, saying he'll be back the following summer.

      In a mid-credits scene, after accidentally crash-landing their helicopter upon realizing the chest had nothing but rocks, Buzz and his accomplice Darren find themselves
      outside a police station, where several police have shown up to rearrest them; much to their dismay.
