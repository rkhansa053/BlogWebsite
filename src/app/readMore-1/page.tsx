      <i>The Garfield Movie</i>
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      In the film, Garfield is reunited with his long-lost father, a street cat named Vic, before being forced into joining him on a high-stakes adventure.
      It is the sixth Garfield film adaptation and the first since Garfield's Pet Force, which was released fifteen years prior.

      Development on The Garfield Movie started at Alcon Entertainment in May 2016. Dindal was announced as the film's director in November 2018, 
      and pre-production began the following month. By 2021, Sony Pictures had already purchased the film rights for global distribution and Pratt was cast as Garfield, 
      with the rest of the cast joining the following year. The film was animated by DNEG Animation, while John Debney, a frequent collaborator of Dindal, composed the score.
      The Garfield Movie premiered at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on May 19, 2024, and was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures through Sony 
      Pictures Releasing on May 24, 2024. Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics who criticized its unfaithfulness to the source material although 
      the animation and voice acting were praised. It was a box-office success, grossing $254.9 million worldwide against a $60 million budget.

      <h2 className="font-bold font-serif">Plot</h2>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
         Garfield is an obese, sedentary, orange tabby cat who lives a pampered average lifestyle with his beagle dog sidekick, Odie, and their owner, Jon Arbuckle.
         One night, while getting a midnight snack, Garfield and Odie are abducted by a Shar Pei, a whippet, and a Western bluebird respectively named Roland, Nolan, and Barry,
         who take them to an abandoned mall as prisoners. Garfield and Odie are soon rescued by the former's estranged father, Vic, whom Garfield hates, believing that Vic had
         abandoned him in an alley back when he was a kitten, on the stormy night he met Jon. The dogs' boss, Jinx, a deranged Persian cat, whom Vic has a history with, arrives
         to exact revenge on him for leaving her behind during a milk heist at Lactose Farms before she was caught and imprisoned at the animal shelter. She lies that she will 
         forgive Vic if he, Garfield, and Odie break into Lactose Farms to steal a large quantity of milk as compensation for her imprisonment, which they reluctantly agree,
         while Roland and Nolan closely observe them.
